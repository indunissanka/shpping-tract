For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

    By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

    Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

    Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

    Cloudflare Pages does not use a traditional "running" command. It automatically deploys static assets after a build process. The build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is `dist`.

    The Supabase table migration script is located in `supabase/migrations/20250116033952_emerald_bridge.sql`.
